class a{
    int k; 
    show();
}


a obj = new a(); ----- normal reference variable obj is crated and it stores the value to the stack and heap both.
                        it's store the obj and hashcodevalue in the stack and refering to the heap.         
                        so it's cleared by garbage collection becouse it's refering the stack to heap.

new a().shwo();  ------ this does not required memory to stack.it's called annonymusobject.
                        it's called the show() mehtod but directliy sotre to heap.
                        garbage collection now clear memory in heap after it's got executed and memory are use efficentliy.
